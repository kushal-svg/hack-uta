# hack-uta
We built an automatic trash can that opens its lid when someone approaches and closes it once they move away. It makes waste disposal more hygienic and encourages recycling.

The project is fully functional and built using C on an Arduino board. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance, a servo motor to move the lid, an LCD screen to display recycling messages, and a buzzer for feedback.
